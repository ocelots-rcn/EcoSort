# EcoSort
## An online open-source data-sorting tool that supports learning of complex concepts

Students and instructors benefit greatly from online interactive data tools that offer hands-on experience that enables them to unpack complex concepts in ecology and evolution. EcoSort enables students to dynamically organize and process data in response to a series of ecological questions posed by the instructor. EcoSort provides students with a tactile experience of sorting virtual ‘cards’ with images, text, or data into categories that address prompts based on ecological questions. The tool also evaluates their sorting performance, providing immediate feedback. By fostering self-guided exploration, EcoSort promotes self-learning, complex thinking, and problem solving and helps students synthesize data into a more holistic understanding of ecological and evolutionary concepts.
